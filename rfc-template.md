# (RFC title goes here)

## Summary

> One paragraph explanation of the change.

## Problem Statement

> Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

> Can we distinguish between essential requirements and 'nice to have' requirements

## Key Assumptions

> Are there any key assumptions underpinning this work which should be highlighted?
These could be assumptions on user behaviour, assumptions on the deployment
context, assumptions on external services etc

## Possible Solutions

> In most cases in which an RFC is required, there is not a single obvious solution
and it makes sense to itemize a few different alternatives/approaches. If that is
the case, these should be included here.

> It can make sense to organize a meeting at which the Problem Statement, Key
Assumptions and Possible Solutions are discussed to explore the problem space
as a lead in to defining the Proposed Solution.

## Proposed solution

> This is the bulk of the RFC.

> Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the 
infrastructure to understand. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, 
and include examples of how the service is used. Any new terminology should be 
defined here.

> It can make sense to organize a meeting to discuss the proposed solution such 
that the proposal is clear, the solution is convincing and the team believes it
can be implemented in a reasonable amount of time.

## Drawbacks

> Why should we *not* do this? Please consider the impact on users,
on the integration of this change with other existing and planned features etc.

> There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Rationale and Alternatives

> Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?

> What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?

> What is the impact of not doing this?

## Unresolved questions

> What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process 
before this gets merged?

> What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation 
of this feature before stabilisation?

> What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be 
addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?
