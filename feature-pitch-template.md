## 🤔 Context and Problem

State the context and frame the problem that needs solving. Make it understandable
for end-users.

## 🍴 Appetite

State the amount of time that should be spent on this and justify it. No strict
minimum, but for trivial things this process is obviously overkill. Maximum should
be no more than 2 sprints (6 weeks).

## 🎯 Solution

Clearly outline the expected solution including proposed interactions
and views, but at no more detail than a breadboard or fat marker sketch.

For CLI functionality, describe rather than prescribe.

## 🐰 Rabbit holes

Be explicit about gotchas to avoid in order to prevent the mini-project from
derrailing.

## 🙅 Out of scope

Explicitly state things that the solution _should not_ address.
