# Redesign Landing Page

Authors: Laura Kinkead, Jimena Dupré

## 🤔 Problem

- The landing page does not well explain what Renku is, and why a user should get excited.
- Renku landing page should be more engaging, with effective CTAs
- The landing page is not state-of-the-art

## 🍴 Appetite

6 weeks for the Copy, Design, and UI to implement the new landing page.

## 🎯 Solution

The main goal is to successfully launch a redesigned landing page that improves the user experience
and answers the three main questions that every user group wants to know: What is Renku?, Why Renku?
and How to use Renku?

### 👥 User Groups & User Journeys

The primary audience for the landing page is people who are hearing about Renku for the first time
and are wondering what it is.

## 🐰 Rabbit Holes

### Customized Landing Page

Admins of other RenkuLab instances should still be able to provide their own landing page.

## 🙅‍♀️ No-gos

- No colors schema changes
- No re-branding
- No content management system
- No Redesign of the menu for authenticated users
- Not in scope: Create a standalone Renku project page that is separate from the instance landing pages (for example, at renku.io).
