- k8s -> Kubernetes
- Helm should set up the quotas etc
- Reword the "modes of operation" section
- Resource pool definition representation should be in tables and more abstract
- the association of user to pool should be independent from pools definition
- what purpose does it have to define "classes" in the pool definition? Is it only to show the user what they can request?

- Definition of pools workflow in Helm values:
 (mandatory)
 - quota for default pool
 (optional)
  - list of nodes
  - label
  - taints
 (optional)
 - quota for any additional pool
  (optional)
  - list of nodes
  - label
  - taints
- Helm sets up:
 - quotas
 - priority class
 - labels
 - taints

The service wants to answer two questions:
 - which _class_ of resources can a user access
 - if the user can have the resources that they request

Who should the service ask these questions? PG or K8s?
